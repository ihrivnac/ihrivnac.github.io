      <description>Overview of the available options for building VMC examples and their default values:
VMC_WITH_Geant4 Build with Geant4 OFF VMC_WITH_Geant3 Build with Geant3 OFF VMC_WITH_MTRoot Build with MTRoot ON VMC_INSTALL_EXAMPLES Install examples libraries and programs ON  Geant4 VMC build options are automatically exported in Geant4VMCConfig.cmake.

      <description>The following instructions apply only to 3.00.b01 (beta) version and are kept for reference purpose only. For the production version (3.0) see Installing and Running Examples page.  Since Geant4 VMC 3.0.x, there are also provided examples main programs which can be built with either shared or static libraries of all packages.

      <description>First, make sure that you have included all libraries paths in your shared library path.
For all MCs:
/your_path/root/lib /your_path/mtroot_install/lib[64]  The MTRoot package is provided in Geant4 VMC and is installed by default with Geant4 VMC library and is located in geant4_vmc_install. It can be however installed also stand-alone and without Geant4 libraries.
For Geant3 only:
path to Pythia6 library /your_path/geant3_install/lib[64] /your_path/examples_install_g3/lib[64] For Geant4 only:
/your_path/geant4_install/lib[64] /your_path/geant4_vmc_install/lib[64] /your_path/examples_install_g4/lib[64] Running examples from Root session The example can be run by calling the provided macros from Root session:</description>
