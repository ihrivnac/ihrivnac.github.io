      <description>The Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) allows to run different simulation Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input and output format as well as the geometry and detector response definition.
The core of the VMC is the category of classes vmc. It provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo, two of which have the key role:</description>

      <description>The core of the VMC, VMC library, provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo:
 TVirtualMC: Interface to the concrete Monte Carlo program TVirtualMCApplication: Interface to the user&amp;rsquo;s Monte Carlo application TVirtualMCStack: Interface to the particle stack TVirtualMCDecayer: Interface to the external decayer TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector: Interface to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive detector  The implementation of the TVirtualMC interface is provided for two Monte Carlo transport codes, GEANT3 and Geant4, with the VMC packages listed below.</description>

      <description>Overview The VMC package provides an abstract interface for Monte Carlo transport engines. Interfaces are implemented for * GEANT3 * GEANT4
each deriving from TVirtualMC implementing all necessary methods.
Before a user can instantiate an engine, an object deriving from TVirtualMCApplication needs to be present which has to be implemented by the user. It contains necessary hooks called from the TVirtualMCs depending on their internal state. At the same time it provides the bridge between the user code and VMC.</description>
