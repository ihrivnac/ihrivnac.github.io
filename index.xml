      <description>The following instructions apply only to 3.00.b01 (beta) version and are kept for reference purpose only. For the production version (3.0) see Installing and Running Examples page.  Since Geant4 VMC 3.0.x, there are also provided examples main programs which can be built with either shared or static libraries of all packages. Building with static libraries can make execution faster, especially when running in multi-threaded mode, than when running with dynamic loading of shared libraries in a &#34;</description>

      <description>The VMC support two ways of geometry definition:
 via Root geometry package (TGeo)  via TVirtualMC interface  (historically the first way)  The first (newer) way is recommended for new users, the way via VMC is kept for a backward compatibility.
Since the version 2.0, user can choose between Geant4 native navigation and G4Root navigation, if geometry is define via TGeo. The choice of the navigation is done via the option specified with creating TG4RunConfiguration  object (see examples  for more details):</description>

      <description>The following instructions apply to the installation of the versions &amp;lt; 2.0.
 First get the Geant3 source from the Download page. No special configuration option for Root installation is needed with the actual version of Root.   With old Root v5.20/00, you have to specify your Fortran compiler:  --with-f77=g77  &amp;nbsp;  geant3 requires Pythia6 library. You can follow ROOT installation instructions or directly the Pythia site.  &amp;nbsp; To install geant3:</description>

      <description>The user magnetic field is in VMC defined via TVirtualMagField  interface and then set to VMC using TVirtualMC::SetMagField(TVirtualMagField*) function. The propagation of tracks inside the magnetic field in Geant4 can be performed to a user-defined accuracy. See more details at the Geant4 User Guide for Application Developers, section 4.3. Electromagnetic Field . Note that while Geant4 allows magnetic, electric and electromagnetic fields, the VMC is currently limited to magnetic fields only.</description>

      <description>The Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) allows to run different simulation Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input and output format as well as the geometry and detector response definition.
The core of the VMC is the category of classes vmc. It provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo, two of which have the key role:</description>

      <description>Root Configuration for geant4_vmc versions (2.x - 2.8)  The older geant4_vmc versions (2.x - 2.8) require Root to be configured with g4root package; for this you have to specify the following configure options:
 &amp;ndash;enable-g4root &amp;ndash;with-g4-incdir=$G4INSTALL/include &amp;ndash;with-g4-libdir=$G4INSTALL/lib/Linux-g++ &amp;ndash;with-clhep-incdir=$CLHEP_BASE_DIR/include \

      <description>Overview The VMC package provides an abstract interface for Monte Carlo transport engines. Interfaces are implemented for * GEANT3 * GEANT4
each deriving from TVirtualMC implementing all necessary methods.
Before a user can instantiate an engine, an object deriving from TVirtualMCApplication needs to be present which has to be implemented by the user. It contains necessary hooks called from the TVirtualMCs depending on their internal state. At the same time it provides the bridge between the user code and VMC.</description>

      <description>Sensitive Detectors Recently (since ROOT version v6.13/04) a new interface to user sensitive detector, TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector, has been added in the set of VMC interfaces. The support fot this new way of settinv sensitive detector is available in geant3 and geant4_vmc development versions.
The user sensitive detectors object should be associated to the selected volumes in the new dedicated MCApplication function
void TVirtualMCApplication::SetSensitiveDetectors()
using the new TVirtualMC function:
void TVirtualMC::SetSensitiveDetector(const TString&amp;amp; volumeName, TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector* userSD);</description>

      <description>Physics list selection Physics Geant4 VMC does not provide any default physics list. User have to choose the physics list from the physics lists provided in Geant4 (see the Geant4 web pages on Hadronic physics lists and Electromagnetic physics builders ) or include their own physics list. The choice of the physics list is done via the option specified with creating TG4RunConfiguration  object. This option is passed as the second argument in TG4RunConfiguration constructor (see examples  for more details).</description>

      <description>The user VMC stack  is used differently in Geant3 VMC and Geant4 VMC. Geant3 VMC pops both primary and secondary particles as they are provided by TVirtualMCStack::PopNextTrack(), while Geant4 VMC pops only primary particles using TVirtualMCStack::PopPrimaryForTracking() from the VMC stack.  Stacking of secondary particles is then handled by Geant4 kernel and the user VMC stack only monitors this stacking. By default, Geant4 VMC saves each secondary particle when it starts its tracking (at the the pre-track phase).</description>

      <description>The way of applying cuts is different in Geant3 and Geant4. While in Geant3, the cuts are defined as a limit in energy, which is applied both as an energy threshold (a secondary particle is not produced if its energy is beyond the threshold) and a tracking cut (a particle is stopped when its energy gets below the cut), in Geant4, there is defined a unique cut in range which is then converted to an energy threshold per particle and material.</description>

      <description>The default Geant4 VMC behaviour, defined by the Geant4 user mandatory classes and user action classes implemented in Geant4 VMC, can be customized by a user by providing his own class derived from TG4RunConfiguration. Such customization is recommended for including a user own physics list. User has also the possibility to override detector construction and/or primary generation action classes and use an existing Geant4 geometry/primary generator definition with VMC. In other cases, though the customisation is possible and allowed by the design, it has not been tested and so it is not recommended especially for the novice users.</description>

      <description>Geant4 visualization and UI drivers can be in Geant4 VMC enabled via dedicated CMake configuration options. See more details in Installing geant4_vmc . The G3-like functions for visualization defined in TVirtualMC are overcome with the interactive visualization capabilities of both Root and Geant4 geometry modellers, that&#39;s why user is encouraged to use these modeller directly. User can set Geant4 visualization options using Geant4 visualization commands, as it is illustrated in the VMC examples  in g4vis.</description>

      <description>The VMC interface provides a common denominator for all implemented MC&#39;s and cannot cover all commands available in a Geant4 user session through Geant4 user interface (UI). Switching between the Root UI and the Geant4 UI gives a user the possibility of working with the native Geant4 UI. It is also possible to process a foreign command or a foreign macro in both UIs:

      <description>Geant4 VMC with Multi-threading Geant4   Since version 3.00, Geant4 VMC supports running Geant4 in multi-threading (MT) mode. The VMC application will run automatically in MT mode when Geant4 VMC is built against Geant4 MT. This default behaviour can be changed via the option specified with creating TG4RunConfiguration  passed as the fifth argument in TG4RunConfiguration constructor.
