This is a repository for statically generated web site using
[hugo]()

The instructions for automatic publishing and hosting the web site via [Github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

- We used "GitHub User or Organization Pages"

- Notes for the step 6:
  There has to be replaced "git@github.com:" with "https://github.com/", the fill command
  used was:

  git submodule add -b master https://github.com/ihrivnac/ihrivnac.github.io.git public
