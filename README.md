# ihrivnac.github.io

This is a repository for statically generated web site using
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

The instructions for automatic publishing and hosting the web site via [Github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

- We used "GitHub User or Organization Pages"

- Notes for the step 6:

  There had to be replaced "git@github.com:" with "https://github.com/", so the full command
  used was:

    git submodule add -b master https://github.com/ihrivnac/ihrivnac.github.io.git public
